# WriterIdentification-AutoencoderExtension
 This repository houses the code and resources related to an innovative extension in writer identification, enhancing the capabilities of DeepWriter through the integration of an autoencoder architecture. The autoencoder adds a layer of feature compression and learning, contributing to improved model performance. Our research aims to bridge the gap between traditional and deep learning techniques in the context of writer identification, offering a nuanced approach to feature extraction and classification. Explore the code, experiments, and findings to advance the field of writer identification in real-world applications.
