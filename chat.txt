To incorporate an autoencoder into your writer identification model and allow it to add an additional class without further retraining, you can follow these steps:

Extract Features with a Convolutional Base:

Modify your model to include a convolutional base (encoder) that extracts meaningful features from the input images. This base can be the same as your existing CNN layers or a subset of them.
After training your writer identification model, remove the classification layers (dense layers) from the model, leaving only the encoder part.
Add an Autoencoder:

Build an autoencoder on top of the extracted features. You can use a shallow autoencoder with 3-4 layers as you mentioned.
The encoder part of the autoencoder should have a bottleneck layer with a reduced dimensionality (latent space) compared to the extracted features.
The decoder part of the autoencoder should aim to reconstruct the extracted features.
Use a separate set of training data for training the autoencoder. This dataset should include samples from all the existing classes and the new additional class.
Implement the Addition of a New Class:

When you want to add a new class without retraining the entire model, you can simply add a new output layer to the autoencoder for the new class. This output layer should have the number of neurons corresponding to the new class.
You can initialize the weights of this new output layer randomly or with small random values.
The existing weights of the autoencoder layers should be frozen to preserve the previously learned features.
Fine-Tuning:

If necessary, you can fine-tune the model by training only the new output layer (classifier) for the added class while keeping the autoencoder layers frozen. You can use a small learning rate for this fine-tuning.
Prediction:

To make predictions for the new class or any existing class, you can use the corresponding output layer of the model without affecting the previously learned features.
